### 3.9.3 Data Alignment 数据对齐

Many computer systems place restrictions on the allowable addresses for the primitive data types, requiring that the address for some type of object must be a multiple of some value K (typically 2, 4, or 8). Such alignment restrictions simplify the design of the hardware forming the interface between the processor and the memory system. For example, suppose a processor always fetches 8 bytes from memory with an address that must be a multiple of 8. If we can guarantee that any double will be aligned to have its address be a multiple of 8, then the value can be read or written with a single memory operation. Otherwise, we may need to perform two memory accesses, since the object might be split across two 8-byte memory blocks.

许多计算机系统对原始数据类型的允许地址施加限制，要求某种类型对象的地址必须是某个值K（通常为2,4或8）的倍数。
这种对齐限制简化了形成处理器和存储器系统之间接口的硬件的设计。
例如，假设处理器总是从内存中获取8个字节，其地址必须是8的倍数。
如果我们可以保证将任何一个double对齐以使其地址为8的倍数，则可以使用单个内存操作来读取或写入该值。 
否则，我们可能需要执行两次内存访问，因为对象可能会拆分为两个8字节内存块。

The IA32 hardware will work correctly regardless of the alignment of data. However, Intel recommends that data be aligned to improve memory system performance. Linux follows an alignment policy where 2-byte data types (e.g., short) must have an address that is a multiple of 2, while any larger data types (e.g., int, int *, float, and double) must have an address that is a multiple of 4. Note that this requirement means that the least significant bit of the address of an object of type short must equal zero. Similarly, any object of type int, or any pointer, must be at an address having the low-order 2 bits equal to zero.

无论数据是否对其，IA32硬件都将正常运行。
但是，英特尔建议对数据进行对齐以提高内存系统的性能。
Linux遵循一种对齐策略，其中2字节数据类型（例如short）的地址必须是2的倍数，
而任何较大的数据类型（例如int，int *，float和double）都必须是4的倍数。
请注意，此要求意味着short类型对象的地址的最低有效位必须等于零。 
同样，任何类型为int的对象或任何指针都必须位于低阶2位等于零的地址。

#### Aside: A case of mandatory alignment （一个强制对齐的案例）

For most IA32 instructions, keeping data aligned improves efficiency, but it does not affect program behavior. On the other hand, some of the SSE instructions for implementing multimedia operations will not work correctly with unaligned data. These instructions operate on 16-byte blocks of data, and the instructions that transfer data between the SSE unit and memory require the memory addresses to be multiples of 16. Any attempt to access memory with an address that does not satisfy this alignment will lead to an exception, with the default behavior for the program to terminate.

This is the motivation behind the IA32 convention of making sure that every stack frame is a multiple of 16 bytes long (see the aside of page 226). The compiler can allocate storage within a stack frame in such a way that a block can be stored with a 16-byte alignment.

#### Aside: Alignment with Microsoft Windows （windows对其的案例）

Microsoft Windows imposes a stronger alignment requirement—any primitive object of K bytes, for K = 2, 4, or 8, must have an address that is a multiple of K. In particular, it requires that the address of a double or a long long be a multiple of 8. This requirement enhances the memory performance at the expense of some wasted space. The Linux convention, where 8-byte values are aligned on 4-byte boundaries was probably good for the i386, back when memory was scarce and memory interfaces were only 4 bytes wide. With modern processors, Microsoft’s alignment is a better design decision. Data type long double, for which gcc generates IA32 code allocating 12 bytes (even though the actual data type requires only 10 bytes) has a 4-byte alignment requirement with both Windows and Linux.
